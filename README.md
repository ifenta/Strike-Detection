# Strike-Detection
Ideally I want to be able to:
- correct different strike and block techniques
- calculate speed of the strikes
- count how many times you do different strikes (flow hitting on a heavy bag for example)

With the camera, I want: 
- correct form now that I can see the whole body and depth
- detect if you are doing a lead or rear punch/kick
- see if I can improve transitions from different techniques
